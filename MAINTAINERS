List of maintainers and how to submit changes
=============================================

Please try to follow the guidelines below. This will make things
easier on the maintainers. Not all of these guidelines matter for every
trivial patch so apply some common sense.

Descriptions of section entries:

	M: Mail patches to: FullName <address@domain>
	R: Designated reviewer: FullName <address@domain>
	   These reviewers should be CCed on patches.
	L: Mailing list that is relevant to this area
	S: Status, one of the following:
	   Supported:	Someone is actually paid to look after this.
	   Maintained:	Someone actually looks after it.
	   Odd Fixes:	It has a maintainer but they don't have time to do
			much other than throw the odd patch in. See below.
	   Orphan:	No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the
			role as you submit your patch].
	   Obsolete:	Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means
			it has been replaced by a better system and you
			should be using that.
	W: Web-page with status/info
	Q: Patchwork web based patch tracking system site
	B: URI for where to file bugs.
	C: URI for chat protocol, server and channel where developers
	   usually hang out, for example irc://server/channel.
	T: SCM tree type and location.
	   Type is one of: git, hg, quilt, stgit, topgit
	F: Files and directories with wildcard patterns.
	   A trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files.
	   F:	drivers/net/	all files in and below drivers/net
	   F:	drivers/net/*	all files in drivers/net, but not below
	   F:	*/net/*		all files in "any top level directory"/net
	   One pattern per line.  Multiple F: lines acceptable.
	N: Files and directories with regex patterns.
	   N:	[^a-z]tegra	all files whose path contains the word tegra
	   One pattern per line.  Multiple N: lines acceptable.
	X: Files and directories that are NOT maintained, same rules as F:
	   Files exclusions are tested before file matches.
	   Can be useful for excluding a specific subdirectory, for instance:
	   F:	net/
	   X:	net/ipv6/
	   matches all files in and below net excluding net/ipv6/
	K: Keyword perl extended regex pattern to match content in a
	   temporary diff of the source code.
	   For instance:
	   K: of_device_id\s*of_table
	   matches patches or files that contain "of_device_id" and
	   temporary "of_table" separated by zero or more whitespace
	   characters.
	   One pattern per line.  Multiple K: lines acceptable.

Note: For the hard of thinking, this list is meant to remain in alphabetical
order. If you could add yourselves to it in alphabetical order that would be
so much easier [Ed]
